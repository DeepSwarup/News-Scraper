      "\n",
      "“Oh god! We’ve got a Labour government!” A delighted member of the Cabinet told me reality only finally hit them when driving through their constituency on Friday, more than a week after voters sent the Tories packing. In the prime minister’s first seven days he’s been confronted with a deeply awkward situation abroad – President Joe Biden’s competence dominating the NATO summit. At home the justice secretary has felt compelled to plan early prisoner releases (it’s unusual a politician would make a willing choice to do that), and doubts over the survival of the steel plant in Port Talbot linger. In other words, Labour is already grappling with the tasks government requires them to do – not the options they would choose. But on Wednesday their own plans will take centre stage, with all the fuss and fanfare Westminster can summon – the attendance of the King, the giant golden throne (yes, really!), the trumpets, the frills and flounces. The first ‘King’s Speech’ will list the law the government hopes to pass in its first year of what Labour already hopes will be a decade in charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images The day will be packed with tradition, with few surprises\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not expect Labour’s plans to include fireworks – no rabbits out of fancy hats. Another Cabinet minister said: \"‘We are still in the mode of no surprises, to do the job we are hired to do.” The speech, however, will be absolutely stuffed with plans. Ministers have vied with each other to get their proposals in. The message, I’m told, has been to do the work, get your stuff ready, and the sooner you can do that, the more likely you are to get a slot for it. The speech will be “rooted in Keir’s missions”, another source said – those “six first steps” that we heard about so much in the election. In case you can’t quite remember what they all were (like the now Health Secretary, Wes Streeting), you can refresh your memory here.\n",
      "\n",
      "What might be in the speech?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday is the start of a drawn-out process of passing at least 30 bills. It will include a couple of dozen new laws, and completing some unfinished business from the old government, as Labour starts to translate its manifesto into new life. Top of the list is getting the economy growing - No 10 and 11’s priority. So expect plans to shake up the planning system, encourage house building, and more powers for the government’s budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. Look out for plans to create Great British Energy, the government’s energy company, to expand workers’ rights, to create the National Wealth Fund - using the power of the public purse for long term investment - and to grant new powers to authorities round the country away from Westminster in the Take Back Control bill (get it?).\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Labour has long planned for power but says the situation it has inherited is worse than thought\n",
      "\n",
      "There are likely to be two new bills from the Home Office - a border security bill so people smugglers can be treated like terrorists and a crime bill to tackle antisocial behaviour and county lines drug trafficking. Plans to reform the Mental Health Act have been promised. Moving the rail industry into public ownership, votes for 16-year-olds and changes to the House of Lords have also been mooted. Rishi Sunak’s smoking ban is expected to be followed through, along with the former government’s vow to end no fault evictions, and to bring in ‘Martyn’s Law’ - legislation to force venues to be prepared for terror attacks, named after one of the victims of the Manchester Arena tragedy. Plans to strengthen the regulation of AI are on the way too. Ministers are under strict instruction not to be categoric about what has made the cut and what has not - even privately. A huge amount of work for the speech was done before Labour’s election win was secure, but the protocol is that these announcements are the monarch’s to make. So until the day itself, we cannot be completely sure if some of the more controversial plans have been passed over this time. Be alert too to the promise of “reviews” or “consultations”. Sometimes taking a good look at a problem before new laws is the logical thing to do – on other occasions, it is a way of placating those arguing for action when ministers aren’t quite ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "If an idea hasn’t made it into the speech this time around, it doesn’t mean it will never happen. Governments are always able to put forward other laws at a later date. But the speech is the government’s formal to-do list, so Wednesday’s priorities are the government’s priorites. Remember, Labour is in a hurry to show they can get things done. Lots of effort has gone in to draft laws that are “tight” and “workable” I’m told, and are ”whole Parliament proof” – meaning laws that can get through the House of Lords. The government has a ginormous majority in the House of Commons, but they have a different audience on the red benches at the other end of the Palace of Westminster. They don’t want to be picking time-consuming fights with the Lords, or creating laws that could be gummed up with hundreds of possible amendments – helpful tweaks - from their lordships. Wednesday will be a huge moment. The buglers will bugle. Black Rod will bang the door. In a nod to the Gunpowder Plot of the 16th Century, the Yeomen of the Guard will conduct a ceremonial search for explosives. The King will wear the crown, and put his name to Labour’s plans for the next couple of years. Hundreds of new MPs will process through the Westminster’s historic halls. And Sir Keir Starmer’s project in Parliament officially begins.\n",

      "'You cannot overstate how dysfunctional it has been’\n",
      "\n",
      "Ministers have already been trying hard to tell a story of just how bad the state of the government is that they have inherited. ”You cannot overstate how dysfunctional it has been,” one minister told me. The Justice Secretary late on Friday even accused the Tories of being the “guilty men”. Clearly there is some information that is only available to those actually in government, but it is worth saying that much of the information new ministers are describing as a ‘shock’ - such as waiting lists and the size of the prison population - are a matter of public record. As we discussed last week, there was a conscious decision by Labour, before they won the election, to tell the public “it’s worse than we thought”. One former Tory minister said: “We need to call out this hokum”. Declarations of surprise also don’t quite match Labour’s boast at being incredibly well prepared for government after months of careful homework and talks with senior officials. But perhaps the shock of being in charge is genuine. One member of the new government said: “I still wake up every morning thinking the previous day is a dream.” The power is real. And on Wednesday we’ll learn more about how Labour plans to use it. Top picture: Reuters\n",

      "\n",
      "Daisy Edgar-Jones, who starred as Marianne in hit TV series Normal People, has said she would like to revisit the role in the future. \"I love those characters,\" the British actress, 26, tells BBC News. \"It would be wonderful to explore them again.\" Based on Sally Rooney's novel, the BBC Three drama charted the on-off relationship of teenagers Marianne and Connell, played by Paul Mescal. Released in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic, it propelled its young leads to fame. Both are now starring in major new films, Edgar-Jones in Twisters and Mescal in Gladiator II. \"Normal People was a series that was such a lockdown phenomenon,\" Edgar-Jones says. \"I think it introduced Paul and I to a lot of people and film-makers,\" she says, adding that she felt \"really lucky\" for the opportunities it opened up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normal People was a lockdown hit in 2020\n",

      "I meet Edgar-Jones in a central London hotel, where she is doing press interviews for her new film. This round of promotion is very different from her experience during the pandemic, when she was \"on Zoom for months on end\". \"I haven't done that many in-person interviews yet,\" she says. \"It's so nice.\" Since Normal People, Edgar-Jones has starred in films like Fresh and Where the Crawdads Sing, true crime mini-series Under the Banner of Heaven, and now Twisters. For a lot of fans, she remains firmly in their minds as the smart and unafraid schoolgirl Marianne, whose relationship with Connell transfixed viewers. A few months ago, Edgar-Jones and Mescal almost broke the internet with an Instagram post that appeared to tease a Normal People sequel. The pair later clarified that, in fact, they were reuniting to host a marathon screening of Normal People for charity. But Edgar-Jones indicates that she hasn't shut the door on it yet. \"If [Rooney] is up for writing a new story, who knows,\" she says. So is she open to the idea? She laughs. \"Keeping it open. Always open.\"\n",

      "Warner Bros Twisters is a follow-up to the 1990s disaster film about tornadoes\n",
      "\n",
      "Having shot to prominence during Covid, Edgar-Jones says fame is only now \"starting to feel real\". \"I can't believe I'm in a film of this scale,\" she says of Twisters. \"It's definitely a pinch yourself moment.\" In the film, a sequel to 1996 blockbuster Twister, Edgar-Jones plays Katie Cooper, a retired storm chaser who returns to the open plains in central Oklahoma to test a new tracking system. Edgar-Jones notes that Cooper, who is haunted by a tragic past encounter with a tornado, bears similarities to other characters she has played. \"I think my characters tend to be, and have been historically, quite introspective. Or characters who have a complex inner life, who are dealing with things that are heavy and emotional,\" she says. She relates to those roles, but adds that she has \"a bit more craic\" than her characters. \"I think maybe I'm more light-hearted. I'm quite silly.\" That said, this film did allow her to have some fun, including running and screaming across fields. \"I did do a lot of running. Which isn't my strong suit,\" she says. \"I've actually got a bit of a weird run, which I've been told, so I actually just tried to practice not looking like an eejit as I was running. That was the main thing.\" She also ate a lot of Oklahoma cuisine on set, possibly offsetting all the exercise she was getting. \"I had something called chicken fried steak, which I'd never had, which is steak - actual steak - which they fry in chicken batter, which was cool\".\n",

      "Edgar-Jones stars opposite US actor Glen Powell as Tyler Owens, a social media superstar who shamelessly chases tornadoes for likes. Powell, who has also starred in Top Gun: Maverick, Anyone But You and Hit Man, is seen by many as Hollywood's latest heartthrob. \"I feel like I have a habit of starring with a lot of the men of the moment,\" Edgar-Jones says. \"I've worked with a lot of really brilliant actors who have buzz around them too,\" she says. She describes Powell as \"magical\", and adds that Mescal is \"one of my all time best friends\". The Normal People co-stars were recently seen together at Glastonbury festival, in pictures posted on social media. \"We had the best time. Glastonbury is maybe one of my favourite places on Earth when the festival's on,\" Edgar-Jones says. \"It's so much fun. I love dancing, I love being with all my friends, I love camping, I love it all. So yeah. We had such a blast.\"\n",

With looming mass job cuts at the steelworks, Ryan said it was a welcome distraction from the day job, where people were feeling \"very demoralised\".\n",

      "It’s been a busy first week for Labour, with a raft of announcements including plans to tackle prison overcrowding, get people back into work and build 1.5 million new homes. But what are the hurdles that lie ahead?\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the cash for wind power\n",
      "\n",
      "Wind is a key engine of change for Labour, who believe it will help the UK economy grow. The new government has promised big steps - doubling onshore and quadrupling offshore turbines by 2030. By removing the ban on onshore wind in England just a few days into power, Labour wants to show this is a key priority. The announcement was welcomed by the industry, with reports of big developers such as Germany’s RWE and France’s EDF wanting to move ahead with new onshore projects. Overcoming local objections about the visual impact of land-based turbines will be vital. Community energy activists say public attitudes are changing, and the potential to offer discounts to local consumers is softening opposition. Offshore, Labour's plans face huge hurdles, with global shortages of materials and skills. The big change that’s needed will be making offshore investments more financially attractive. Last year, there were no takers at a government auction for new contracts to develop offshore wind, with firms saying the price set was far too low. While Labour starts with great goodwill, it will ultimately be cash that decides whether their wind promises are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will new homes help first time buyers?\n",
      "\n",
      "In her first speech as chancellor, Rachel Reeves vowed to \"get Britain building again\", to boost economic growth. Compulsory housebuilding targets ditched by the previous Conservative government are back, and Ms Reeves said the government was willing to take an “interventionist approach” to achieve them. As stated in Labour’s manifesto, ministers want 1.5 million homes built in England in five years. That’s a daily average of 822 homes, or roughly a new housing estate, every day. But a target is one thing, and delivering a level of housebuilding not seen since the 1960s is another. The plans will rely significantly on private housebuilders. While they may have the capacity, the market conditions and commercial justification will have to suit them. Questions have already been raised about whether a sufficiently skilled workforce is available. And strap yourselves in for some battles at local level when council planning committees face potentially stiff opposition from residents. Perhaps the biggest questions of all for young voters is whether this will all make a first home cheaper or easier to buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making a clear plan to fix the NHS\n",
      "\n",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting made headlines within hours of starting, declaring the NHS \"broken\" because of the long waits patients face. Tackling the backlog for hospital treatment was a key priority in Labour’s manifesto. It promised an extra 40,000 appointments and operations a week in England, by getting NHS staff to work weekends and using the private sector more. But that will not be easy. Despite more money and staff, the NHS has struggled to increase the number of patients its sees in recent years. Mr Streeting has not set out much more detail, except for announcing an investigation into performance led by NHS surgeon and independent peer Lord Ara Darzi. That will report back by September. If the new government is to achieve its aim of getting waiting times back on track, a clear plan and signs of progress will need to follow quickly.\n",

      "Questions over defence spending remain\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Keir Starmer was lucky to have a Nato summit in his first week. It gave him an early chance to meet important allies, including a one-on-one meeting with US President Joe Biden. The prime minister also met key European leaders, promising a reset in Britain’s relations with the EU. The summit allowed him to demonstrate his government’s support for Ukraine, confirming the UK would continue to provide £3bn in military aid each year. Sir Keir announced a strategic defence review would begin next week and said his commitment to spending 2.5% of national income on defence was “iron clad”. But he faced criticism for refusing to say when or how that target would be met. The challenge for the prime minister and other Nato allies will be how to remain united in their support for Ukraine, as not all are equally resolute. They must also plan for the possibility of a Trump presidency that could see a significant reduction in US military backing for Kyiv.\n",

      "\n",
      "The number of people who are economically inactive due to ill health has risen by 700,000 since the pandemic, to 2.8 million. The government’s big idea to tackle rising levels of worklessness is to create a new national jobs and career service. It would be based in job centres, but with local areas able to tailor the scheme depending on their own employment needs. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has praised initiatives in Manchester, where the Greater Manchester Combined Authority has invested money in programmes such as Working Well. This helps people with health conditions and disabilities get “the right job, at the right time.” Who are the millions of people not working? The biggest challenge will be changing perceptions of job centres. For many, they aren’t places to find work and instead mean fearful encounters with officials focussed on ensuring claimants comply with benefit rules. “Take a job - any job - or you’ll lose your benefits,” has been the message the unemployed have often left with. If that image doesn’t change, the government’s plan could well be stymied.\n",

      "How to deal with asylum seeker backlog?\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour’s manifesto promised to scrap plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda and set up a new Border Security Command (BSC) to tackle the people smuggling gangs moving tens of thousands of people across the English Channel in inflatable boats. After taking up office, the prime minister swiftly confirmed the end of the Rwanda plan, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there would be “rapid recruitment of an exceptional leader\" for the BSC. Labour said the new BSC would be partly funded by diverting £75m from the Rwanda policy, set up by the Conservatives in 2022. By the end of 2023, £240m had been paid to Rwanda. However, Rwanda has said it will not be giving any money back. The one diplomatic mistake of Labour’s first week was its failure to inform the Rwandan government before announcing the end of the joint migration policy, which angered Kigali. Labour also promised to end the \"perma-backlog\" of asylum seekers whose claims are not being processed because of the Illegal Migration Act, which says people who arrive illegally cannot claim asylum. However, the new government has not said how it plans to deal with the estimated 100,000 people caught in this legal limbo.\n",

      "Tough talk over water bills\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour's so called \"crackdown\" on water companies includes ring-fencing money for infrastructure investment so it doesn't leak out into bonuses, dividends or pay increases. New customer panels will be able to summon water executives to answer for their performance. Compensation payments to households and businesses whose basic services are not up to standard will more than double. But water firms have said a proposed average 21% hike in bills in England and Wales by 2030 won't be enough to address problems including sewage leaks. It is a third less than the amount they requested. They are now in a stand-off with regulator Ofwat over how much prices can rise. What the government wants to avoid is having to nationalise a company like Thames Water, which is drowning in £18bn of debt and says it only has enough cash to last 11 months. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has warned nationalising water companies is not something it wants to do. He says it would “cost money we do not have” and slow down the process of reducing pollution levels. Labour is talking tough, but solving the stand-off between the firms and the regulator is one of the big issues it now has to resolve.\n",

      "\n",
      "The police file on one of the UK's most notorious unsolved murders shows a prime suspect had told officers he intended to kill a black man. Kelso Cochrane, a carpenter from Antigua, was stabbed to death in May 1959, during an attack by a white gang in Notting Hill, west London. No-one was ever charged. The murder came a year after the 1958 Notting Hill race riots, but police said there was no racist motive and that Cochrane had been killed for money. For years, requests to release the file were rejected but members of Cochrane’s family obtained it through a Freedom of Information request. Millicent Christian, daughter of Cochrane’s cousin, says it was “so emotional” to hear the file was being opened. But now, after reading the first tranche of papers, both she and her brother Louie have “mixed feelings”. The file reveals that one of the suspects, John William Breagan, had already been jailed for stabbing three black men, and had told police at the time of his arrest for that crime that he would kill the first black man he saw after his release. Cochrane’s murder came 10 days after Breagan left prison. With that evidence available at the start, Millicent and Louie cannot understand why the investigation never progressed. “Within two months of the murder officers are admitting it was unlikely to be solved,” says Louie. “That’s crazy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The murder\n",
      "\n",
      "The file contains a wealth of detail about the events surrounding the killing and the police investigation. The attack occurred on the night of 16 May 1959, as 32-year-old Cochrane was returning from Paddington General Hospital, where he had received treatment for a broken thumb. His fiancee, Olivia Ellington, told police he had already had medical treatment once but his thumb was still hurting and he couldn’t sleep. So he got up and went back to hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on his return that a gang of white men surrounded him on Southam Street in Notting Hill, near the junction with Golborne Road. Two Jamaican passers-by came to his rescue and took him to another nearby hospital, where doctors discovered he had been stabbed in the chest with a very thin blade. Cochrane was pronounced dead at 01:00 in the morning on 17 May. Even though white youths had attacked black residents in Notting Hill a year before, this was the first time a black person had been killed in the area. It made the papers’ front pages and caused widespread alarm, especially among the Windrush generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigation\n",
      "\n",
      "Det Supt Ian Forbes-Leith took on the case hours after the murder, and deployed a large team to start house-to-house enquiries. Dr Mark Roodhouse, an expert on policing in London in the 1950s, describes the first stage of the investigation as very thorough. “It quickly led to them identifying key suspects,” he says. “But when the next stage developed, which was interrogating those suspects, things seem to slow down.” Officers began by interviewing witnesses. One of the Jamaicans who had helped Cochrane remembered him saying: “Those chaps asked me for money. I told them I didn’t have any. They started to fight me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other people who had seen the attack were reluctant to talk, a police report in the file says. Two women who had watched what happened from their windows were described as “evasive”. “One feels they are not telling all they know,” the report says. Another witness, Michael Behan, said he saw two white youths running to the junction where the attack took place. He identified one as John William Breagan, who was 24. Breagan had been at a party nearby, along with Patrick Digby, who was 20, and a group of their friends - all young white men, many with criminal records.\n",

      "Getty Images Detectives search for a murder weapon in Edenham Street, west London\n",
      "\n",
      "Digby was interviewed just after 18:00 on Monday 18 May. He initially denied leaving the party. He said he had got drunk and “passed out” - only waking in an armchair at about 08:00 the following morning. He was interviewed again two hours later, and this time admitted leaving the party with John Breagan, known as “Shoggy”. He said they had got into an argument with someone and went for a walk to “cool their feelings”. A group of white youths passed them, he told police, walking in the direction of Southam Street. When he and Breagan turned into the street, there was no sign of the youths but they saw a black man sitting in the gutter. They then saw two other black men come to the seated man’s aid. This statement was of “paramount importance” to police: it put Digby at the scene. They detained him, and searched for Breagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime suspects\n",
      "\n",
      "By 01:00 in the morning of 19 May Breagan was being interviewed too. He told police that he and Digby had left the party to look for girls, as there “wasn’t enough to go round”. He claimed they went for a walk and saw a black man sitting down in Southam Street. Breagan said he told Digby: “Come on. We don’t want to get any trouble with people like that.” Police described this account as “most unsatisfactory”. They believed Breagan and Digby “had put their heads together and concocted a story to account for their presence at the scene of the attack if they happened to be identified by witnesses”. But their stories were contradictory. The police recognised that “obviously one or both were lying” about why they had left the party. They detained Breagan too.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Digby was “a known troublemaker” according to the police, Breagan was a far more “vicious” character. Two years earlier he had been sentenced to three years in prison for three separate unprovoked attacks on black men, all on the same day, stabbing them in the face and the body. It was when he was arrested for these offences that he told two police officers, using a racial slur: “If I do time for this, when I come out I’ll kill the first [black person] I see. I mean that too.” Cochrane was murdered 10 days after Breagan was released. Millicent Christian says she was “speechless” when she saw this comment in the files. “How could police miss this?” she says. “He has said exactly what he was going to do.”\n",

      "In one of the newly released documents, police described Breagan and Digby as “strong suspects”. Over the next 48 hours all efforts were concentrated on them. But although they had good evidence that racism could be a factor, publicly the police ruled it out. A senior Scotland Yard told journalists that officers were satisfied “it was not a racial killing” and that robbery had been the motive. Mark Olden, the author of an investigation into the case, Murder in Notting Hill, says that after the riots in 1958, there was concern at the highest levels about reaction to the Cochrane murder. He says the only explanation is that police were “concerned about a repeat or worse of the race riots of the year before” and that “public order concerns were foremost in their minds”. At the time, he adds, everyone in the local community “thought it was a racist attack”.\n",

      "At about 19:00 on 20 May, Breagan said he wanted to do another interview. This time he said he had stopped Digby from getting into a fight at the party, and had suggested they go for a walk. The file doesn’t indicate why he changed his statement, which now tallied with Digby’s. Mark Olden - who spoke to Breagan before he died - says he told him they had been held in adjacent cells at the police station, which allowed them to communicate and “straighten” their stories. Police wrote that they were now “reluctantly obliged” to release both men without charge.\n",

      "'Squalid slum area'\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 1,000 people had been interviewed by mid-July, when Det Supt Forbes-Leith produced a report to sum up what had been achieved. “Despite the most exhaustive enquiries… not one shred of evidence has been forthcoming to suggest who the culprits were,” he wrote. He noted there was a “general feeling” that Digby and Breagan were responsible, together with others who had been at the party with them. But he added: “This, however, is surmise and not one of the group has had a finger pointed at him with certainty.” His views were echoed by his superior officer, Chief Supt James Dunham, who said that despite prolonged interrogation of the two suspects and “scientific examination” of their clothing nothing had emerged to connect them to the “murderous act”. Dunham said a large proportion of those interviewed were “inveterate liars”. “Little or no information has been forthcoming from residents or habitues of this squalid slum area,” he wrote. The only way to make progress would be to use “‘outside’ information or assistance”, he said. It is not clear what this means. Certainly, the case did not move forward from that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both prime suspects - Breagan and Digby - are now dead, along with many of the witnesses. Yet for decades the Metropolitan Police said the case was still open. So even though the files had been transferred to the National Archives, they could not be released because information might prejudice the “detection of crime”, under Section 31 of the Freedom of Information Act. Over the years many people have tried to get the files open - including me. But the Kelso Cochrane family, with expert legal support, assembled a comprehensive Freedom of Information application. When it was turned down, they appealed and won. The Metropolitan Police told us that “our thoughts remain with Mr Cochrane’s family”, and that any new evidence that came to light would be “assessed and investigated accordingly”.\n",

      "\n",
      "As Joe Biden attempted to calm the storm engulfing his presidential re-election campaign, he hit an early snag: referring to \"Vice-President Trump\" during a Thursday press conference when he meant Kamala Harris. Within minutes, Donald Trump mocked the gaffe on his social media platform, Truth Social, with an accompanying clip. \"Great job, Joe!\" he wrote. It was the kind of reaction voters have come to expect from Trump, who has spent years insulting the president, 81. And yet, for the past two weeks, as Mr Biden was fighting for his political life, Trump remained uncharacteristically quiet, letting Democrats argue among themselves. Republican strategists claim the relative silence is down to Trump's new-found discipline - a change from his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. \"He's played it brilliantly by not saying much about the Democratic crisis,\" said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former senior Senate and House leadership aide. \"Why take the shovel away when they're digging their own hole?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Defiance, slip-ups and high stakes: Biden spars with media\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump, 78, has not gone entirely underground. Since Mr Biden's poor debate performance in late June, Trump has given a handful of radio interviews, appeared at rallies in Virginia and Florida, and kept up a steady drumbeat of posts on Truth Social. \"The radical left Democratic party is divided in chaos,\" Trump said at a Tuesday campaign rally in Miami. \"They can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president, sleepy, crooked Joe Biden or laughing Kamala.\" He also challenged the president to a golf match, claimed all US airports were dirty, said that visitors to Washington DC end up \"shot, mugged and raped\", claimed 45,000 people were at the Miami event when there were closer to 700, and pondered why \"we don't eat bacon anymore\". But experts say that compared to past behaviour, the Republican has been restrained. Some have suggested Trump's camp may even be delaying his choice for vice-president to avoid stealing attention from Mr Biden's problems. \"If you compare this strategy and execution [in] this campaign to 2016 and 2020, it is far more strategic, far more disciplined,\" said Kevin Madden, a Republican communications expert who worked on Mitt Romney’s presidential bids. With the Democratic Party fracturing over Mr Biden's candidacy, Corey Lewandowski, Trump's 2016 campaign manager, said the approach taken by Trump since the debate had been effective. \"The Trump campaign has done an outstanding job of allowing the Biden campaign to self-destruct,\" he said.\n",

      "That implosion may have been what the Trump campaign was banking on from the start. The Republican plan to win over the American people has, for a while now, leaned on voters' well-documented fears about Mr Biden's age. Speaking to The Atlantic's Tim Alberta, Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita said he had planned for an \"extraordinarily visual\" match-up where Mr Biden was viewed as old and frail while Trump appeared strong and vigorous. \"The debate was exactly what they wanted,\" Mr Madden said. \"They got the perfect split-screen that was going to endure.\" What world leaders thought of Biden's Nato performance\n",

      "A number of recent polls put Trump consistently - if still narrowly - ahead of Mr Biden. But there is concern within the Trump camp that anxiety over Mr Biden's fitness has peaked too soon. Were he to be replaced by a younger nominee, Trump would lose two main lines of attack - age and frailty. And it would be harder to directly blame a new candidate for the president's perceived policy failures: Mr Biden scores badly with voters on the economy and the southern border crisis. \"They're silently hoping, with their fingers crossed, that Biden is the nominee,\" said strategist Ron Bonjean of Trump's campaign. \"They feel they will win the election with Biden as their opponent.\" Some of Trump's closest surrogates have seemed to suggest they want Mr Biden to stay on. On Thursday, while Democrats parsed the impact of the president's defiant press conference, Trump's son Don Jr offered rare praise. Mr Biden's performance had been \"not too bad\", he said. \"He did fine enough to be able to stay in it - he doesn't want to go.\" Last week, Trump's daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Lara Trump, suggested it would \"go against the democratic process\" if Mr Biden were to be removed. Nevertheless, Mr Bonjean and other Republican experts made clear that if it was hard for Republicans to take on a new candidate, it would be harder still for Democrats to choose one.\n",

      "\"Yes, it will cause the Trump campaign to scramble a little bit.

Mr Heye suggested that the convention - four days of party fanfare built around a candidate who revels in the spotlight - will have made it easier to sell Trump the benefits of the strategy of remaining largely quiet. \"If you're committed to keeping your candidate under wraps for an extended period, there has to be a pay-out later on,\" he said. \"His leadership can say: 'You've got all of next week, it's going to be the Donald Trump show'.\"\n",

      "To get a sense of the public interest in the Vision Pro, Apple's very high-tech, very expensive virtual reality (VR) headset - finally launched in the UK and Europe on Friday - where better to head than one of its own stores? In the past, people camped outside Apple branches overnight, so desperate were they to get their hands on the tech giant's latest product. When I went to its branch in central London on Friday morning, though, there was just a small group, mainly comprised of men, waiting for the doors to open. Partly, that's because people these days prefer the convenience of pre-orders. But it also perhaps tells us something about the question that continues to hang over the VR headset market: will it ever escape the realm of tech aficionados and go truly mainstream? Apple's plan to make its product break through is to position it as a product you use to do the stuff you already do – only better. Home videos become 3D-like, panoramic photos stretch from floor to ceiling, 360 degrees around you. Apple keeps reminding me it calls this “spatial content”. Nobody else does. Plenty suck their teeth at the Vision Pro's price though - a whopping £3,499. Facebook owner Meta has been watching Apple’s approach closely. It’s been in the VR game a long time. At a recent demo for the Meta Quest 3, which has been available in the UK since 2023, the team was very keen to talk to me about “multi-tasking” – having multiple screens in action at once. In a demo I had a web browser, YouTube and Messenger in a line in front of me. “We always did this, we just didn’t really talk about it,” one Meta worker told me. And in its most recent advertisement, a man wears a Quest 3 to watch video instructions while building a crib. Not the most exciting concept, perhaps, but it shows just how Meta wants people to see its tech. Oh - and it costs less than £500.\n",

      "Getty Images It is believed Meta's Quest series of headsets have sold more than 20 million units worldwide - though the firm does not release sales figures\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple and Meta are the two big players but VR is a crowded market - there are dozens, maybe hundreds, of different headsets already out there. But what unites them all is none have quite hit the mainstream. Up until now, the Vision Pro has only been on sale in the US - research firm IDC predicts it will shift fewer than 500,000 units this year. Meta, which has been in the market longer, does not release sales data for the Quest either but it's thought to have sold around 20 million worldwide. VR headsets are nowhere near as ubiquitous as tablets, let alone mobile phones. And it gets worse - George Jijiashvili, analyst at market research firm Omdia, said of those devices sold, many are abandoned. “This is largely due to the limited in-flow of compelling content to keep up engagement,” he said. But of course lack of content leads to reduced interest - and a reduced incentive for developers to make that content in the first place. \"It's a chicken and egg situation,\" Mr Jijiashvili told the BBC. Alan Boyce, the founder of mixed reality studio DragonfiAR, warned that early adopters of the Vision Pro would have to “be patient” while more content arrived. That's where the Quest 3 wins out for him - it already has a \"robust library\" of games, and it can perform virtual desktop tasks just like the Vision Pro. And IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo says we should not be too quick to write off a slow start for Apple’s new product. “There’s always the expectation that Apple with every single product will sell in the millions straight away, there’s always the comparison with the iPhone,” he said. But the reality is even the iPhone took time to find its feet - and a huge number of buyers. According to Melissa Otto from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the iPhone only became mainstream when the App Store \"started to explode with apps that added value to our lives\". \"When people start to feel their lives are becoming better and more convenient, that's when they're willing to take the leap,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The VR experience\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another factor to consider here too though: the physical experience of using a headset. Both Apple and Meta use so-called \"passthrough\" technology to enable what is known as mixed reality - the blending of the real and computer-generated worlds. By utilising cameras on the outside of the headset, users are given a live, high-definition video feed of their surroundings - meaning they can wear it while doing things like walking or exercising. But strapping something to your face weighing half a kilogram is not something that feels particularly natural. Generally headsets now are lighter than before, but I still can’t imagine wearing any of them for hours on end - though a colleague says he often does just this. A sizeable number of people, myself included, have experienced VR sickness, which is when being in VR makes you feel queasy. This has significantly improved as the tech has advanced and is much less of a problem - but any experience that has you moving around with a controller instead of your feet will still take some getting used to. Most VR experiences now include all sorts of settings to avoid this, such as the ability to \"teleport\" between locations. Sony's VR game Horizon: Call of the Mountain solved the problem by letting you move by swinging your arms up and down - it sounds silly, but it goes some way to trick the brain and avoid nausea.\n",

      "The parliamentary Conservative party is dazed and confused, even grief-stricken. Many knew a big defeat was coming, though some were in denial. All agree that the reality of life in opposition is even worse than expected. “It’s like Lehman Brothers around here,” one Conservative MP muttered, as he saw yet another ousted colleague wander past carrying a cardboard box holding their belongings. “There are a load of MPs I thought I’d be spending decades with in this place,” said another. “They’re really good mates. And almost all of them are gone. It’s a reminder of how vulnerable we all are.” And here’s one of the few remaining members of the Conservatives’ vast 2019 intake: “It’s not great to feel like a greybeard when you’ve only been here four-and-a-half years.” It’s in that emotional state that the remaining MPs need to start answering questions about where to go next. But they are in no hurry to do so. Indeed it’s hard even to know what the right questions are. Most glaring and immediate, of course, is the question of who should succeed Rishi Sunak. The fact that no-one has yet declared their candidacy - and there appears to be no particular clamour for them to do so - tells its own story. As one shadow cabinet minister put it: “Look at 1997 and look at 2005 - 2005 was a lot longer and went a lot better.” In 1997, the last time the Conservatives were ejected from government, John Major was replaced by William Hague within 49 days. In 2005, it took seven months for David Cameron to be chosen to replace Michael Howard. Lord Hague’s four years as leader were forlorn, Lord Cameron led the Conservatives back into government. “The question I hear people asking each other the most,” one Conservative MP said, “is who is our David Cameron?” In some quarters, the drift towards a longer leadership election betrays a lack of enthusiasm for the likely candidates. One influential backbencher suggested that postponing the start of the contest would allow MPs to see how the putative candidates take to the task of opposition, for example responding in the King’s Speech debate or tabling urgent questions to cabinet ministers. For others, though, a long campaign is an opportunity to have a more fundamental debate about how the Conservatives should rebuild. “The problem is we lost votes everywhere at once,” one MP on the right of the party said. “Lots want us to just think about the challenge from Reform, and we must, but we can’t ignore our other former voters.” Consider a couple of constituencies for a moment.\n",

      "Getty Images The Conservatives lost Boston and Skegness to Reform UK\n",
      "\n",
      "After the 2019 general election, Boston and Skegness was the second-safest Conservative seat in the country. The party won 76.7% of the vote with Labour limping in second on 15.2%. Last week Reform UK claimed the seat, even though the Labour vote stayed roughly the same. If every Conservative loss were like that, the party’s clear incentive would be to focus relentlessly on those voters they lost to Reform. But then look at Stratford-on-Avon. At the 2019 election the Conservatives won this seat with 60.6% of the vote, way ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 24.3%. Last week, the Liberal Democrats won the seat, the first time anyone but a Conservative had won there since 1906. Yet the Conservative vote collapsed in more than one direction. Lots of votes were lost to the Liberal Democrats but Reform claimed 14.6% of the vote too. If those votes had gone to the Conservatives, the party would have just clung on to the seat.\n",

      "\n",
      "That’s before you even get on to all the seats where Conservative voters defected in large numbers to Labour. But it’s far from straightforward to assume that Reform votes would have just flowed to the Conservatives without Nigel Farage’s involvement. “Most Reform voters don’t like the Conservative Party,” says Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester. “They courted them for two years and it did nothing. “Conservatives assume that because most Reform voters backed the Tories in 2019 that they are low-hanging fruit, easy to win back. But this doesn’t follow. They feel let down by the Conservative Party, and just saying nice things to them isn’t going to cut it for them. Even if you can get some of them back you will lose others in doing so.” Even those MPs who think the Conservatives need to prioritise the Reform UK vote admit there is uncertainty about what’s behind the party's surge. “The big question about Reform is whether it’s just about immigration,” one MP on the right of the party said, “or whether it’s also about economics and trust. Some of us think it’s something much bigger, a bit like a Marine Le Pen moment. “If we’re right, then it’s no good just pitching for Reform votes by going harder and harder on immigration, because you can never satisfy enough of them, and with some of them you wouldn’t want to. And in the meantime you’re turning off Lib Dems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Conservative said: “The answer is we need to find a way to appeal to voters we lost to all parties. I don’t know how you do that on policy, but Keir Starmer showed you can do it by looking competent and serious. But I don’t know if any of the candidates we have at the moment can do that.” Others worry, though, that a long leadership contest will allow Labour to develop new arguments about their inheritance in government from the Conservatives, with the Conservative Party too distracted by internal wrangling to hit back. “The only vulnerability Labour will leave us is on small boats - they really don’t have a plan,” one said. “But we won’t be able to beat them on that because of our record. So that leaves space for Reform.” In opposition, though, the matter of attacking the government is mechanical as much as it is about narrative and policy. And the stark reality of the Conservatives’ depleted ranks is that they are going to find it hard to be an effective opposition. There are likely to be somewhere between 80 and 90 government ministers to shadow. Appoint a shadow frontbencher to correspond to each one and you’re left with only about 30 backbenchers out of 121 MPs. That’s before two deputy speakers. “I guess we’re going to have to pick and choose which jobs we really want to shadow,” one current shadow minister said. “There’s going to be lots of doubling up. I don’t know how that will all work.” From the existential to the mundane - that’s the range of questions a traumatised Conservative Party now has to consider. And they don’t all think they will get it right. “If there’s one thing this campaign has taught me,” one Conservative official said, “it’s that things can always get worse.”\n",

      "Of all the bold announcements a brand-new government would like to be making, the early release of prisoners surely isn’t among them. But on Friday ministers will say that some offenders in England and Wales will be let out after they’ve completed 40% of their sentences, the BBC has confirmed. Currently prisoners serving standard determinate sentences - that is, those with a fixed end date - are released after serving 50%. This change in policy won’t include serious criminals such as sex offenders, rapists and terrorists. Instead, shoplifters and those convicted of drugs offences are among those likely to be released sooner. Sources say it will most likely amount to a number in the low thousands leaving prison early in the coming weeks and months. It’s a short-term fix that will free up cells quickly. And it’s happening because there simply aren’t enough resources to cope with the rising number of people being locked up. There have been numerous warnings, including from the Prisons’ Governors' Association, that the estate was “just days away” from reaching full capacity. On 5 July official figures showed the prison population was 87,453 out of a total capacity of 88,864 - meaning there were just 1,411 spaces left. A member of staff at HMP Wandsworth in south-west London, one of the worst-affected prisons, told me that it was “bursting at the seams” and officers were having to put prisoners in cells that should have been taken out of action. “We put two inmates in a cell where the toilet was overflowing,” the member of staff said. “We had nowhere else to put them… The smell was so bad you couldn’t breathe.” The previous Conservative government had already resorted to emergency measures to deal with the crisis. At first, some inmates were let out under supervision up to 18 days early and later, as the situation grew even more dire, up to 70 days early. Then in October last year, the Ministry of Justice stopped all non-essential maintenance work because it couldn’t afford to close cells at a time when every space was needed.\n",

      "'Shocking'\n",
      "\n",
      "Two factors in particular have driven the growth in prison numbers. The number of people on remand has risen by 84% since 2019 and now accounts for 20% of the overall prison population, according to the Institute for Government think tank. And the proportion of those being recalled after breaching the terms of their licence has also risen sharply – up 72% since 2019. Both these factors have been fuelled by a post-Covid backlog in the criminal courts, which has meant people waiting for a lot longer for hearings and trials. Also, even though recorded crime has fallen according to the Office for National Statistics, changes in sentencing policy have contributed to more and longer custodial sentences. Asked by reporters during his visit to Washington DC what he had discovered now he was in office, Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said that “some of what we have found is shocking” and singled out prisons in particular. He added that “the situation is worse than I thought it was”. However, meetings between Labour and officials about how to tackle the looming crisis began weeks ago, during the election campaign. Arguably, Labour's anticipated early-release policy is in line with the views of the newly appointed prisons minister. James Timpson told Channel 4 News earlier this year that a third of inmates shouldn’t be in prison in the first place. Overcrowding has exacerbated many of the problems at the heart of the penal system. Too many inmates means less attention on rehabilitation, prison staff have persistently told me, because staff are spread more thinly. This affects their ability to provide work and training for inmates. Most inmates are eventually released, and how they’re treated inside can shape their behaviour once they’re out in the community - charites such as the Prison Reform Trust vigorously argue for better conditions partly for this very reason. But there are pitfalls to the government’s plan. Critics warn that it won’t make overcrowding go away and that early releases could in fact create new problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year Charlie Taylor, the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales, described the issue of overcrowding as a “ticking time bomb” but warned early releases would not be enough to prevent it “blowing up”. For instance, early releases have a knock-on effect for the Probation Service. When offenders on determinate sentences are released early, they are supervised by probation officers and must adhere to certain conditions, such as sticking to curfews. But the Probation Service is already struggling with its workload. A report published by the HM Inspectorate of Probation earlier in the year said senior probation officers “had too many responsibilities which get in the way of their focus on the quality of work delivered by their teams”. Jason Barnfarther, 23, who recently served time in prison for drug offences, described being told he was to be released sooner than expected. “All of a sudden, within 24 to 48 hours, you’re getting ushered out the building,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Barnfarther says early releases have a negative impact on the resettlement of offenders\n",
      "\n",
      "This can make probation officers’ jobs even more challenging. Confusion over offenders’ release dates can cause problems when it comes to finding accommodation for them. “You can release people early as much as you want, but if you don’t resettle them, it’s not going to do anything,” said Barnfather. There are concerns that if the Probation Service can't cope, then offenders could miss curfews and potentially reoffend, meaning more recalls to prison. This will do little to ease overcrowding and rebuild public confidence. Early releases are also unlikely to be a popular move with some victims whose lives have been significantly impacted by crime. Some argue for tougher and longer sentences as a deterrent and punishment. The Victims Commissioner for London, Claire Waxman, said that the previous government’s policy of releasing prisoners up to 70 days early “notably made the presumption that stalkers and domestic abusers are eligible. We know that reoffending rates for offences like these are high, and so I urge this government to exempt domestic abuse and stalking\". However, I understand that the current government is considering not releasing those convicted of such offences early. Prisoners don’t have a lot of public sympathy - after all, they’ve broken the law and are being punished for it. But an overcrowding crisis could have serious consequences both for them and staff, who are often working longer hours and processing more inductions. As one prison governor put it: “This could cost lives, because staff are under immense pressure and are worried they might miss something, which could lead to an inmate taking their life or seriously self-harming.” This issue will be the first big test faced the new government. How it responds is sure to be scruitinised closely by critics. Top picture: Getty Images\n",

      "It's long been known that our lifestyles can help to keep us healthier for longer. Now scientists are asking whether new technology can also help slow down the ageing process of our brains by keeping track of what happens to them as we get older. One sunny morning, 76-year-old Dutch-born Marijke and her husband Tom welcomed me in for breakfast at their home in Loma Linda, an hour east of Los Angeles. Oatmeal, chai seeds, berries, but no processed sugary cereal or coffee were served - a breakfast as pure as Loma Linda’s mission. Loma Linda has been identified as one of the world’s so-called Blue Zones, places where people have lengthier-than-average lifespans. In this case, it is the city’s Seventh-Day Adventist Church community who are living longer. Listen to Lara read this article on BBC Sounds They generally don’t drink alcohol or caffeine, stick to a vegetarian or even vegan diet and consider it a duty of their religion to look after their bodies as best they can. This is their “health message”, as they call it, and it has put them on the map - the city has been the subject of decades of research into why its residents live better for longer. Dr Gary Fraser from the University of Loma Linda told me members of the Seventh-Day Adventist community there can expect not only a longer lifespan, but an increased “healthspan” - that is, time spent in good health - of four to five years extra for women and seven years extra for men. Marijke and Tom had moved to the city later in life, but both were now firmly embedded in the community.\n",

      "There’s no great secret to Loma Linda. Its citizens are simply living a really healthy life, keeping mentally stimulated and valuing the community a religion can often provide. There are regular lectures on healthy living, musical get-togethers and exercise classes. I chatted to Judy, who lives with 112 others at an assisted living facility where there was always the “ability to have heart-opening, brain-opening conversations”, she told me. “What I didn't realise was how important socialisation is to your brain... without it, it seems to shrink and go away,” Judy said. Science has long recognised the benefits of social interactions and avoiding loneliness. But now it's also possible to identify whose brains are ageing faster than they should, so they can be tracked and in future potentially be treated better preventatively. As we move towards more personalised, predictive, preventative healthcare models, early diagnosis will be crucial in all areas of health - powered by the incredible possibilities of AI and big data.\n",

      "Computer models that assess how our brains age and predict their decline were shown to me by Andrei Irimia, associate professor of gerontology and computational biology at the University of Southern California. He had created them using MRI scans, data from 15,000 brains and the power of artificial intelligence to understand the trajectory of both brains that are ageing healthily and those in which there is a disease process, such as dementia. “It's a very sophisticated way to look at patterns that we don't necessarily know about as humans, but the AI algorithm is able to pick up on them,” he said. Prof Irimia did, of course, take a look inside my head. I'd had a functional MRI scan ahead of my visit and, after analysing its results, Prof Irimia told me I had a brain age eight months older than my chronological age (although apparently the bit that controls talking wasn’t ageing so much. I could have told him that). However, Prof Irimia suggested that the results fall within a two-year error margin. Private companies are starting to commercialise this technology, too. One firm, Brainkey, is offering the service in a variety of clinics around the world. Its founder Owen Philips told me that in future, getting an MRI should become easier. \"It’s becoming much more accessible for people to get an MRI scan, and the images coming off them are getting even better and better,” he said. “I don't mean to nerd out there. But the technology is just getting to a point where we are able to see things much earlier than we could in the past. And that means we can understand exactly what's happening in an individual patient's brain. With AI, we can support that.” In contrast to what Prof Irimia’s analysis of my MRI scan had told me, Brainkey’s estimate knocked a year off my brain’s biological age. I was also presented with a 3D-printed model of it, which appeared substantial and, I was assured, was life-sized.\n",

      "The aim here is not just a more precise approach to treatment, but also to be able to quantify how well any interventions are working. Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the past 200 years have given rise to a host of age-related diseases. I did wonder whether, if we all lived long enough, dementia might come knocking at all our doors. Prof Irimia said this was a theory many have investigated albeit not proven, adding that the aim was to find a way to keep on pushing dementia back, hopefully beyond our life expectancies. And all of this takes us back to the same point. Every scientist and doctor, as well as those Blue Zoners, say lifestyle is key. Good diet, keeping active, mentally stimulated and happy are crucial to how our brains age. There’s another important factor too, according to Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the best-selling book Why We Sleep. “Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do every day to reset your brain and body health,” he evangelised. “There is no operation of your mind that is not wonderfully enhanced when you get sleep, or demonstrably impaired when you don’t get enough.” He spoke of our brains’ cleansing system, which functions during our slumber by washing away the beta-amyloid and tau proteins - these are “two of the main culprits underlying Alzheimer’s”. Changes in sleep patterns are also associated with dementia. Prof Walker described how we don’t just see this in our 60s or 70s - it can begin during our 30s. So, identifying those changes through sleep tracking could potentially become a “model of midlife prevention”.\n",

In this state of torpor, as it is known, the squirrels’ body temperature drops and their metabolic rate is reduced to just 1% of normal. During this time, they appear to be able to regrow neurons and remake the connections their brains had lost. The company’s aim is to try and create drugs to replicate this process in humans, without them needing to spend half the year underground. Even if some may long for that. Untreated depression has also been shown to raise our risk of dementia. Professor Leanne Williams of Stanford University has identified a method of “visualising” some forms of depression on the brain using an MRI scan, and thus seeing if treatment has worked. This may be able to help scientists understand more about the root causes of mental health conditions such as depression, as well as providing a way to quantify how treatment is going for a patient.

      "For the next six months, Hungary holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. Mr Orban followed up his first visit to Kyiv since the start of the war with the first trip by an EU leader to Russia since April 2022. That visit to the Kremlin clearly angered his European partners. Charles Michel, the head of the European Council of 27 EU governments, said the rotating presidency gave no mandate to engage with Russia on the EU’s behalf. Mr Orban admitted that was the case, but insisted: \"I’m clarifying the facts… I’m asking questions.\" In Kyiv he posed \"three or four\" to President Zelensky \"so that we can understand his intentions, and where the red line is, the boundary up to which he can go in the interest of peace\". He has also been generous in his praise of two other allies, Xi Jinping and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Meeting Mr Erdogan on arrival at the Nato summit in Washington, he spoke of him as \"the only man who has overseen an agreement between Russia and Ukraine\" so far, referring to a now defunct Black Sea grain agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images Mr Orban's whistlestop tour began with a visit to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on 2 July\n",
      "\n",
      "\"China not only loves peace but has also put forward a series of constructive and important initiatives [for resolving the war],\" he said of President Xi Jinping, according to Chinese state media. The final visit on his whirlwind tour was to presidential candidate Donald Trump, another close ally who he strongly backs to win again in November and who he refers to as a man of peace. In one interview, he declared that during Trump’s four-year term as president “he did not initiate a single war\". This has been a remarkable trip in the international limelight for the leader of a small East European country with 9.7 million inhabitants. But who is it designed to impress, and could it have any effect? A key target of his message is the domestic public. Viktor Orban has had a relatively bad year so far, losing the two most prominent female politicians in his party to a scandal in February, and witnessing the emergence of his first serious challenger for more than a decade - Peter Magyar. In June, Mr Orban’s Fidesz party won an impressive 45% in European elections, to 30% for Mr Magyar’s three-month-old Tisza party. But he lost more than 700,000 votes (one in four) compared with the last parliamentary elections in 2022. For the first time, he does not look invincible. What better way to show Hungarians that their leader was still strong than to parade across the world stage, in a global tour \"to make peace\"? His mission was also targeted at an international public, in the week that his new Patriots for Europe (PfE) group in the European Parliament attracted 84 MEPs from mainly far-right parties in 11 countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patriots for Europe has emerged as the third largest faction in parliament, edging aside the rival Conservatives and Reformist group of Italy’s Giorgia Meloni. Mr Orban's visit to Moscow won him effusive praise from the Russians: “We take it very, very positively. We believe it can be very useful,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The US was less impressed. “We would welcome, of course, actual diplomacy with Russia to make it clear to Russia that they need to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, that they need to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity,” said US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. “But that is not at all what this visit appears to have been.” At the same time, the US did welcome Mr Orban's first visit to neighbouring Ukraine since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion.\n",

      "A gaffe-free night for Biden, says BBC reporter in Detroit\n",
      "\n",
      "As Joe Biden took to the stage for a rally in Detroit, Michigan, on Friday evening, one of the most raucous crowds seen in recent years at any event for the US president chanted: \"Don't you quit!\" The presumptive Democratic nominee was greeted by deafening cheers from hundreds of supporters as he vowed: \"I am running! And I'm gonna win!\" As he left the stage, the strains of Tom Petty's hit I Won't Back Down washed over the high school gymnasium, an implicit rebuff to the growing list of elected members of his party exhorting him to step aside amid concerns about his age. But for all the headlines dominated by the latest politician, donor or liberal actor to turn on Mr Biden, a longer list of Democrats are sticking by him. At least 80 Democratic politicians have publicly backed the 81-year-old, and more are joining them as he insists he is going nowhere. To many, his political record, his principles and his 2020 victory over Donald Trump mean more than the damage of a rambling performance in any debate or public appearance, or health fears during a new four-year term. In Mr Biden's first solo news conference of the year on Thursday, he gave detailed responses on Nato and his plans for a second term, but many headlines focused on his flub in referring to his deputy, Kamala Harris, as \"Vice-President Trump\". His allies - for now, at least - praised the embattled commander-in-chief's performance, which was watched live by over 23 million people - a bigger audience than this year’s Oscars. \"I thought he showed a real command of foreign policy, really extraordinary,\" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told reporters on Friday. \"I don’t think Donald Trump can talk about foreign policy coherently for one minute.\" Gavin Newsom, the California governor touted as a possible successor, told CBS he was \"all in\" for Mr Biden, adding that there was \"no daylight\" between them. Congressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said Mr Biden \"showed he knows a million times more about policy\" than Trump, \"the convict conman\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Defiance, slip-ups and high stakes: Biden spars with media\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts say these politicians have a host of reasons for their support, including Mr Biden's record in office, his 2020 victory against Trump and the gamble of putting in a new candidate so close to the November election. \"The president has made it clear he wants to continue to run, and I think people are being very respectful of that,\" said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist. \"And it's also true that in our system, replacing a candidate for president this late is hard and is unprecedented, and so there's enormous reticence about making a big change.\" He added that there was a \"healthy debate\" about who the nominee should be. However, a range of groups have said that the candidate should be Mr Biden, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has about 40 members, and the 60-member Congressional Black Caucus, which Mr Biden met earlier this week. Ameshia Cross, a former Obama campaign adviser, said that the black caucus, as well as many black voters, see Mr Biden as a president committed to civil rights, unlike his rival, Trump. \"They understand what is at stake with a Donald J Trump presidency,\" she said. \"This is a guy who has stood against DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\" Mr Biden has received public support from several politicians on the left, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who have previously criticised Mr Biden for an agenda they have said is too moderate. Ms Cross said many recognise the risks a Trump presidency brings to civil and LGBTQ rights and climate change. \"These are things that matter to the progressive left, and the president has actually worked on those things,\" she said. To date, most of Mr Biden's support comes from politicians running for re-election in reliably Democratic districts, rather than those who worry Mr Biden could harm their own election chances in tougher seats. Mr Rosenberg said that the White House \"needs to be respectful of their concerns and deal with them, I think, in a far more aggressive manner\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as calls grow for Mr Biden to exit the race, the most recent poll seems to suggest that he has not lost much voter support. The Biden campaign has touted a survey from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos published this week, which shows him and Trump in a dead-heat, similar to survey results from before the debate. But the poll also found two-thirds of Americans want Mr Biden to step aside. The president has also lost support from some among the Hollywood elite. Actress Ashley Judd called on Mr Biden to step down in a USA Today op-ed on Friday, saying the party needed a \"robust\" candidate. Her article followed an even more damning opinion piece this week by George Clooney about Mr Biden. Longtime Democratic donor Whitney Tilson is the latest fundraiser to pull the plug, telling the BBC on Friday that he was increasingly confident Mr Biden would go. Other Democratic donors told a pro-Biden fundraising group, Future Forward, that pledges worth some $90m (£69m) were on hold until he exits, reports the New York Times. Other top donors, however, are sticking by the president.\n",

      "Shekar Narasimhan, who has been organising fundraisers for Democrats for more than two decades, said there had been no change in his plans. \"Our eyes can see what’s going on, our ears can hear what's being talked about but we are keeping our heads down to get the work done,\" said Mr Narsimhan, who is the founder of the Asian American Pacific Islander Victory Fund Super-PAC. \"It's the president’s decision to make, whether he wants to run or not, and we will go with whatever he decides,\" he said. \"But it's better to end this discussion as soon as possible.\" He said his support for Mr Biden came from the belief that he would win. \"This election will be decided by no more than a total of 50,000 votes in three states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - and we have the ground game and infrastructure to win there,\" he said. Frank Islam, who sits on the National Finance Committee, said he had a fundraiser planned at his Maryland home later this month. \"I am absolutely going ahead with it because I know he [Mr Biden] will win,\" he said.\n",

      "Competition between mortgage lenders has intensified ahead of a key decision on interest rates by the Bank of England. A host of lenders have made reductions to the cost of new fixed-rate mortgages in recent days. Brokers expect further cuts to come, but mortgage rates remain much higher than homeowners became accustomed to for a decade. Lenders' funding costs have hinted at falling with the Bank forecast to cut benchmark interest rates for the first time in four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts believe that move, from the current 16-year high of 5.25%, could come on 1 August, although this remains far from certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costly loans\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest rate on a fixed mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it. Doing nothing would leave people on a variable rate, which can be very expensive. About 1.6 million existing borrowers have relatively cheap fixed-rate deals expiring this year. They may be moving off a rate of less than 2%, so face significantly higher repayments on their next home loan. The average rate on a two-year fixed deal is 5.92%, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts. The average five-year fixed rate is 5.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospect of a lower Bank of England rate has offered better signals for lenders' funding costs, leading many to lower the rates they charge customers. They will also study the moves of their rivals, and their own levels of custom, to judge where they set the costs. Many major banks have cut rates in the last two weeks, including Barclays which has done so three times, as well as Nationwide, Virgin, Coventry and Skipton, among others. Aaron Strutt from mortgage broker Trinity Financial said there was \"more positive news\" coming from lenders. He suggested anyone who had recently agreed a new deal might still have time to renegotiate something better. While the moves have led some to suggest sub-4% deals could return to the market soon, others are more cautious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kylie-Ann Gatecliffe, from KAG Financial, said many predictions of falling rates had proved to be wrong. However, she said clients were telling her they had chosen to move now, having delayed during the upheaval of the last couple of years. She said people were looking in more detail at their options, such as whether to borrow more to move home, or instead to fund home improvements.\n",

      "'Knife-edge' decision\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent report by the Bank of England said that about three million households were set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years, including 400,000 mortgage holders who were facing some “very large\" payment increases. Renters also remained under pressure from the cost of living and higher interest rates, it said. Leading lenders have also said that housing affordability is stretched owing to high mortgage rates. The UK economy grew faster than expected in May, leading some analysts to comment that a cut in interest rates by the Bank was more likely in August, while admitting the decision was still on a knife-edge.\n",

The 4 July election saw only 56% of voters fill out their ballot papers in Wales, compared with 60% across the UK.\n",

      "In Abertillery Arcade, home to shops and cafes, Barbara Burden, 76, and Alan Johnson, 72 spoke to BBC Wales Politics while enjoying a mid-morning cup of tea. Neither voted in the election. Barbara said: \"My father was a proper Labour man. He always voted for Labour and he'd say to me 'women fought for you to have the vote', so you should vote - but I haven't for a few elections now.\" Both said they felt their votes wouldn't make a difference to them or the area.\n",

      "\"We want to see what Labour do first, see what it'll do for Abertillery - then I may vote in the next one,\" said Alan. Elaine Sandra Curtis, who was shopping in the town, said she did vote. \"I voted for change, but whether there will be change in the valleys - that's another question,\" she said. She said the area had been forgotten by politicians. \"I was waiting for candidates on my doorstop, I didn't see a soul.\" One reason voter turnout was low, she said, could have been due to the fact many may have assumed it was a safe Labour seat.\n",

      "Joshua Hill runs Hearthside Games which is based in the arcade. He said he started the business last year because it was easier to set up his own business rather than finding a job in the area. He said: \"I did vote as I think it's important to show how you feel, but it is difficult here because it feels like no one in the area cares.\" Joshua said wasn't surprised to hear turn out in the was low. \"A lot of people feel it doesn't matter who you vote for because no one cares about these areas anyway, we're rural and out the way, and kind of get left out.\" Samuel Hale, 21, was also in the game store and said he decided not to vote. \"If I'm honest I wasn't entirely sure who to vote for, and I'm not shocked voter turnout was low here. There's not much around here, it's out of the way.\"\n",

      "PA Media Welsh former Labour leader Neil Kinnock said poor turnout in Wales to vote was \"appalling\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this week former Labour leader Neil Kinnock said the low turnout in parts of Wales in last week's general election was \"appalling\". Labour's vote share in Wales dropped from 40% to 37%, which Lord Kinnock said the party was \"deeply concerned\" about. Despite some people telling us they didn't think their vote would make a difference, there were some tight margins between candidates in Wales which made every vote count. The tightest was Clwyd North which saw Gill German for Labour win her seat by 1,196 votes. Other constituencies that saw a close margin with less than 2,000 votes between the top two candidates were Llanelli, Mid and South Pembrokeshire, and Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe.\n",
